   In this modest work, we designed and developed a web application for the early prediction of **type 2**
   diabetes, in order to reduce the risk of complications of this disease on the patientâ€™s health. To achieve this goal, we used algorithms supervised machine learning (K nearest neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Natives Bayes) and the data set extracted from the hospital in Frankfurt (Germany). The performance of classifiers was compared based on accuracy rate and model sensitivity. The highest classification rates obtained by the application of Random Forest and the decision tree are respectively 91% and 87%, by applying the two methods of evaluation train /test and cross validation.
